Good afternoon,

Happy Holidays! In the spirit of gift giving, I would like to give back to the research lab that gave me excellent mentoring in multiscale molecular simulations and python programming. With a day and a half of free time over winter break, I have designed a new responsive, dynamic website for the McCabe Research Group at (link) to upgrade the 2012 version(link).

Please let me know if you would like any features or content to be added or removed from the website. In the next week or so, I can transfer the domain url to (link), so other sites can refer to the updated design and hopefully greater exposure to MuMs will occur.

I hope you all have an enjoyable holiday weekend.

Best,

Davy Yue
